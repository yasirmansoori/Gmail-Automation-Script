# Vacation Buddy
- Do you want to spend your vacation stress-free, or are you sick of receiving these emails? This Node.js script automates the processing of unread emails in your Gmail account. It retrieves unread emails, checks for prior replies, and sends a predefined response if none exist. It also adds a custom label ('Vacation') to the email and moves it out of the inbox.
